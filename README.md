# Commons APIs

Welcome to **Commons APIs** - your open, free, and collaborative platform for accessible APIs!

## Vision

Our mission is to create a **Wikipedia for Open Source APIs**: a freely available, community-driven collection of APIs designed for everyone - engineers, researchers, students, and curious minds alike.

We believe that access to reliable, easy-to-use APIs should be **open and free** for all, empowering innovation, education, and discovery across disciplines.

## What We Offer

In the first step, Commons APIs provides **simple, foundational APIs** focused on:

- International System of Units (SI units) - base and derived units  
- Basic formulas and constants from various scientific and engineering fields  
- Data about countries, languages, prefixes, and translations  

Our APIs are designed to be **lightweight, easy to integrate, and openly accessible** to support your projects, research, or learning journey.
